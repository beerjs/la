# BEER.JS / DRINKS.JS - Los Angeles

This happens on the last Thursday of every month following the formal [JS.LA][jsla] event. While the presentations are cool and all the informal meet up after is where you get to know your fellow Los Angelinos doing JS. Watch this repo as well as the [JS.LA][jsla] site for updates.
